# Welcome to Lane-follower!

Build a model using keras / tensorflow for outputing a int between -70 : 70 for the steering wheels 
based on a streamed image from the RC.

* Each have their own team ( hopefully )
* Build the model and output a pickle file in the /models directory with your team name like so: /models/team_name.pkl
* Each team will push the models to ```git push origin master team_name```
* We estimate that training with regular CPU takes about ~30 min
* Dedicated time for testing the models will be at
 * time
 * time
 * some other time
* There is no competition here, but we hope that everyone can make at least one lap around the court
